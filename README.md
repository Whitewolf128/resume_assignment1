# resume_assignment1
A code version of my resume without the css

1.Can I explain what my code does?
it makes a webpage that is stylized and can be easy to navigate.

2.What was my coding process?
made divs to add containers and made it accessible to those who have mouse issues.

3.What challenges did I have?
had problems with file location thankfully i had a backup got to remember not to put it in the Onedrive.

4.What would I do differently now?
not to place the files in the Onedrive as well as to use tabindex to make it accessible and add the font in as code not download it as a file.
